This is a textbook for teaching Decision Theory/Rational Choice Theory.  It was written by Kevin Zollman for use in upper division undergraduate and lower division graduate classes at Carnegie Mellon University. 

The aim of the textbook was to provide an introduction to the topic that was more technical than many of the existing philosophical textbooks (e.g. Resnik and Skyrms), but less technical than the classic economics textbook (Kreps).  The textbook is presented at a moderate level of mathematical detail.  Material is rigorous, but very little mathematics is presumed.  Almost everything is limited to a finite domain, for example.
